Predicting Domestic Gross Of Movies is my second project at Metis.

In this project, I applied regression algorithms:

• Scraped data from boxofficemojo.com by using BeautifulSoup

• Trained and optimized Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models

• Chose Ridge Regression model as the best predictive model and predicted domestic gross of movies

TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

scraped data from www.boxofficemojo.com

IMDB Movies Dataset from https://data.world/popculture/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

Language: Python

Libraries: beautifulsoup, sklearn, statsmodel, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
